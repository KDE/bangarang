Bangarang is a KDE media player.

The project, scratches my itch: To have a media – audio and video – player that gets the basics right with a not-overwhelming interface.

Why do it? Simple. Because I want to. Nothing more complicated than that.

As much as possible, the pillars of KDE and existing KDE infrastructures are/will be used, and constructive feedback provided to the respective projects.
