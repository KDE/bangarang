The icons in this directory are used by ../mainwindow.ui

The sole purpose is to allow shared use of Qt4 Designer to more correctly visualize mainwindow.ui during design.

Just add an icon here and point to it in Qt4 Designer.

NOTE: This is for design purposes only.  Icons should be replaced with a proper KIcon in code.

Use of Qt4 Designer for editing ui files is strongly recommended.  We can work on making ui files more efficient after we get the interaction models nailed down.
